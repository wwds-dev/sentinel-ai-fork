# Sentinel documentation

Sentinel is a local-first desktop command centre with seven built-in agents: Chat, Trace, Bloodhound, Beacon, Bug Spray, Tunnel, and Forge. Bloodhound also includes a read-only file finder for user-selected local folders and authenticated SSH machines. It filters by name, type, size, or modified date and never uploads file metadata to an AI provider.

Writing and Coding are tools inside Chat. Creative publishing, audiobook, health, investing, and sports-betting workflows are outside the current Sentinel product.

See the project-root [`README.md`](../README.md) for setup, usage, architecture, safety boundaries, and testing. Individual current-agent guides are in [`docs/agents/`](agents/). Task-based user training is in the [`Learning Centre`](training/README.md) and is also available inside the application.

The supported removable-drive workflow is documented in
[`portable_mode.md`](portable_mode.md). It includes isolated storage, upgrades,
safe ejection, backups and the portable-only Emergency Reset. That reset erases
only Sentinel-owned portable data; it must not be described as Tails-style,
amnesic, trace-free, drive formatting or forensic secure erasure.

Files describing the earlier workspace split are retained as historical engineering records and should not be read as current product instructions.
