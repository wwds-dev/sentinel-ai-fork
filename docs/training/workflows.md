# Agent workflows

Larger goals often benefit from more than one agent. Review results between
stages; Sentinel should not automatically pass sensitive material to another
agent or cloud provider.

| Goal | Suggested flow | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Research a public identity | Trace → Bloodhound → Forge | Sources, connections and a structured report |
| Review an authorised website | Trace → Bug Spray → Forge | Context, findings and a remediation report |
| Improve a personal network | Beacon → Tunnel → Chat | Wi-Fi observations, VPN guidance and a checklist |
| Find and organise files | Bloodhound → Chat → Forge | Selected files, interpretation and an index/report |
| Diagnose a software issue | Chat → Forge | Explanation followed by a concrete fix or deliverable |

## Workflow 1: public identity research

1. **Trace** validates the identifier and creates a focused plan or collects
   consented public records.
2. Review matches and remove unrelated people or unsupported assumptions.
3. **Bloodhound** turns the verified starting material into a deeper dossier.
4. Review sources, confidence and risk statements.
5. **Forge** is appropriate only if you need an agent scaffold; for an ordinary
   written report, use Chat's Writing tool or export the reviewed result.

Do not transfer a complete email address, personal image or case file to a
cloud provider merely for convenience.

## Workflow 2: authorised website review

1. Record the written scope, target and permitted test window.
2. **Trace** can collect public domain/company context without probing the app.
3. **Bug Spray** receives only the in-scope target and relevant evidence.
4. Run conservative authorised reconnaissance if necessary.
5. Review the PoC, CVSS, impact and remediation before preparing a submission.

Stop if the target leaves scope, becomes unstable or contains unexpected
personal data.

## Workflow 3: secure personal connectivity

1. **Beacon** checks the current interface, reachability and visible Wi-Fi
   conditions on an authorised network.
2. **Tunnel** designs the correct remote-VPS or home-LAN topology and renders a
   configuration locally.
3. Apply changes outside Sentinel with a recovery path.
4. Return non-secret diagnostic output to **Chat** for a plain-language checklist.

Never place VPN private keys in Chat or an AI-backed diagnostic request.

## Workflow 4: locate and understand files

1. **Bloodhound File Discovery** searches explicitly selected folders using
   metadata filters.
2. Select only the relevant results; do not upload the full device inventory.
3. Use **Chat** to compare non-sensitive excerpts or plan organisation.
4. Use normal file tools for any move or rename—Bloodhound remains read-only.

## Workflow 5: design a new specialist

1. Use **Chat** to clarify the problem and remove unnecessary capabilities.
2. Use **Forge** to generate a structured agent spec.
3. Review providers, tools, budget and approval requirements.
4. Create the inactive scaffold, inspect the code and add tests.
5. Integrate it deliberately; creation does not equal production readiness.

## Handoff checklist

1. Confirm the goal and authorised scope.
2. Keep only information the next agent genuinely needs.
3. Review whether the next route is local or cloud.
4. Run the next agent and verify its result before continuing.
5. Use Forge for a finished output only after the evidence is reviewed.

## Choosing where to pause

Pause whenever the next stage changes the target, sends information to a new
destination, incurs cost, executes a real scanner, writes files, or requires
privileged access. The handoff is a decision point, not an automatic pipeline.

Security-testing agents are for systems, networks and programs you own or have
explicit permission to assess.
