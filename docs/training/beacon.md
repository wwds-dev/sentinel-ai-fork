# Beacon — authorised Wi-Fi assessment

**Goal:** diagnose your network and understand the lab-only Kali workflow. **Time:** 20 minutes.

![Beacon workspace](docs/training/images/beacon.png)

Use Beacon only on networks you own or have written permission to test.

## Modes

- **Interface Info** describes the selected Mac network interface.
- **Scan Networks** lists nearby wireless networks visible to the device.
- **Signal Monitor** follows signal conditions over time.
- **Ping Test** checks reachability to the host you enter.
- **Kali Command Builder** prepares reviewed command sequences for a separate
  authorised Kali lab; it does not silently run them on the Mac.

Select the correct interface (often `en0`) and enter a target host only for Ping
Test. **Detect Adapters** identifies known USB adapters and reports whether their
chipset is expected to support monitor mode or injection. Detection is guidance;
drivers and operating-system support still matter.

## Adapter and internet setup

You do **not** need an external adapter for Interface Info, Scan Networks,
Signal Monitor or Ping Test on macOS. Those diagnostics can use the Mac's
built-in Wi-Fi. The external adapter is for monitor mode and packet injection,
which generally happen inside Kali rather than macOS.

Use **Run Preflight** before preparing Kali work. It only reads status: it lists
interfaces, marks the current default route as **Internet / control**, and shows
known USB monitor adapters. It never changes mode, disconnects Wi-Fi or runs an
intrusive command.

The recommended arrangement is two interfaces:

1. Keep the Mac's built-in Wi-Fi or Ethernet connected for internet, model
   access and control.
2. Dedicate the supported USB Wi-Fi adapter to Kali and monitor mode.

A single Wi-Fi adapter cannot stay associated with an access point in ordinary
managed mode while that same adapter is in monitor mode. If it is your only
connection, switching it can remove internet access. Preflight warns when it
cannot find a separate routed connection.

For a Kali virtual machine, select the USB adapter in the hypervisor's USB
passthrough menu. It will normally disappear from macOS while attached to the
guest. Kali must have a matching chipset driver, and some hypervisors, hubs and
Apple-silicon guests have USB or driver limitations. Confirm the adapter appears
in Kali before following generated commands. Make every mode change yourself;
Sentinel intentionally does not do it silently.

Kali mode requests an operation, adapter, BSSID, channel and ESSID. Intrusive
operations can disconnect users or disrupt service. Run them only in an
isolated lab or during an explicitly approved test window. Review every command
and confirm the target identifiers before using it outside Sentinel.

**AI interpretation** is optional and off by default because raw network output
may reveal device names, addresses and infrastructure details. Prefer a local
model; redact unnecessary details before approving a cloud route.

## Exercise

Run Interface Info and a Ping Test against your own router. Explain the
difference between passive observation and an intrusive lab operation before
opening Kali Command Builder. Then run Preflight and confirm that you can explain
which interface keeps internet access and which would be dedicated to monitoring.
