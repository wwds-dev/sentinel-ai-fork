"""The interface an agent panel needs from the application.

This protocol records the shared application capabilities that independently
testable agent panels may use: providers, logging, budgets, history, and common
request controls.

Panels talk to the host through this protocol rather than reaching into `GodAI`,
which is what lets a panel move to its own module (phase 4) and eventually to a
different application without carrying the whole window with it.

Runtime-checkable so a test can assert a stand-in satisfies it; `GodAI` conforms
structurally and does not inherit from it.
