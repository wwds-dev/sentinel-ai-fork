"""
killswitch.py — Fail closed when the tunnel drops.

Without this, a tunnel that dies takes your protection with it and says
nothing: macOS falls back to the ordinary route and your traffic carries on
over the ISP, unencrypted, looking exactly like it did a second earlier. The
Monitor tab notices and warns, but by then packets have already left.

Armed, the rule is inverted — anything that is not the tunnel is dropped, so a
dead tunnel means no traffic rather than unprotected traffic.

Three deliberate choices, all of them about not bricking your network:

  Rules live in a named pf anchor, never the main ruleset. Apple owns
  /etc/pf.conf and ships its own anchors in it; loading into `vpn-agent-killswitch`
  means flushing ours can never disturb theirs.

  The switch does not survive a reboot. A kill switch that comes back on its
  own after a restart is one you cannot escape without knowing pfctl — the
  machine boots with no network and no explanation. Rebooting is a deliberate
  act, so failing open there is the safer trade.

  Endpoint hostnames are resolved to addresses at arm time. DNS is blocked once
  armed, so a rule naming a hostname could never be evaluated; pinning the
  addresses is what lets the tunnel be rebuilt while the switch is on.

If anything goes wrong, recovery is one command and it is printed everywhere
this module reports state — see recovery_command().
