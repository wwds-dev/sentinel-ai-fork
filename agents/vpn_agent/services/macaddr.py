"""
macaddr.py — Changing this Mac's hardware address.

Worth being blunt about the scope, because this is the most over-estimated
privacy measure in common use:

  A MAC address travels exactly one hop. The café's access point sees it, your
  home router sees it, and nothing beyond that ever does — it is stripped and
  replaced at the first router. It has no bearing on what a website sees, on
  what your ISP sees, or on anything the VPN is for.

  What it is genuinely good for: not being trackable *by the network you are
  joining*. Venue wifi that logs MACs can otherwise recognise the same laptop
  across visits, and across venues under the same operator.

  On recent macOS, Wi-Fi already does this for you. "Private Wi-Fi Address" is
  on by default and gives every SSID its own stable random address, which is a
  better design than one address you change by hand. Check Settings › Wi-Fi
  before assuming this adds anything. Ethernet and USB adapters get no such
  treatment, and that is where this earns its place.

  The change does not survive a reboot, and re-associating is required for it
  to take effect on Wi-Fi.
