"""
backup.py — Encrypted export and import of a whole site.

The site file is the only copy of the server's WireGuard key and the OpenVPN
certificate authority. There is no recovery: lose it and every config you have
issued is permanently dead, with no way to reissue one. Until now the only
mitigation was a warning in the docs.

This makes moving or backing up a site a supported operation rather than a
manual file copy — which matters most exactly when it is riskiest, carrying keys
to a second machine or off the laptop entirely.

The format is deliberately boring and self-describing:

    scrypt(passphrase, salt) -> 32-byte key -> AES-256-GCM

scrypt because it is memory-hard, so a stolen backup file cannot be attacked
with cheap parallel hardware the way PBKDF2 can. AES-GCM because it authenticates
as well as encrypts: a file that has been altered fails to decrypt rather than
yielding a subtly wrong site. The KDF parameters travel inside the envelope, so
a backup taken today still opens after they are raised.

The passphrase is never stored, never logged, and never written anywhere. Lose
it and the backup is as gone as the original.
