"""
store.py — Reading and writing site state.

Site files contain private keys, so every write goes through paths.write_private
and every read verifies the file is not group- or world-readable. A site file
that has become readable by others is reported loudly rather than silently
loaded: by the time you notice, the key material may already have been copied.
