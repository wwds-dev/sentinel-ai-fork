# Sentinel

Sentinel is a local-first PySide6 desktop command centre for security, investigation, and controlled AI-assisted workflows. It supports local Ollama models and explicitly enabled cloud providers, records request usage and cost, and keeps each specialist workflow behind a clear panel and permission gate.

**Current release: v2.001.** The canonical value lives in [`VERSION`](VERSION)
and is shown beside **SENTINEL** in the app. See the
[versioning policy](docs/versioning.md) for numbering and release steps.

Sentinel's built-in roster is intentionally limited to seven agents:

| Display name | Key | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Chat | `chat` | General conversation plus Writing, Coding, Summarize, and Rewrite tools |
| Trace | `osint` | Focused open-source research and source-led investigation planning |
| Bloodhound | `osint_heavy` | Deep OSINT dossiers plus read-only file discovery in user-selected folders |
| Beacon | `wifi` | Wi-Fi diagnostics and commands for networks the operator is authorised to test |
| Bug Spray | `bug_bounty` | In-scope vulnerability analysis and submission-ready bug bounty reports |
| Tunnel | `vpn` | Real WireGuard/OpenVPN connect, profile-aware checks, action previews, and self-hosted VPN design |
| Forge | `manager` | Creates and reviews specifications for new agents and tools |

Writing and Coding are Chat tools, not standalone agents. Creative publishing, audiobook, health, investing, and sports-betting workflows are not part of the current Sentinel product.

## Run locally

Requirements:

- Python 3.11 or newer
- the packages in `requirements.txt` (runtime) or `requirements-dev.txt` (development and builds)
- Ollama for local inference, or an API key for any cloud provider you choose to enable

From the project directory:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python main.py
```

API keys are read from the process environment or the project `.env` file in development. Supported provider variables include:

```text
OPENAI_API_KEY
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
GOOGLE_API_KEY
KIMI_API_KEY
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY
DASHSCOPE_BASE_URL
```

Only enable a paid provider when you intend to use it. Sentinel checks provider permissions and configured budgets before a request, then records the resulting run and usage. Kimi's cached-input rate is priced separately from its base input rate (roughly 80% cheaper), so a request that reuses recent context costs less than the headline per-token estimate would suggest.

## Using the app

Choose an agent from the left sidebar. Chat uses the shared centre workspace; each specialist has its own panel with the inputs and actions relevant to that workflow. Provider and model controls remain explicit, and the recommended selection is highlighted where available.

Chat's Tool selector changes its system guidance:

- **General Chat** for open-ended assistance
- **Writing** for editing, tone, clarity, and structure
- **Coding** for code generation, explanation, debugging, and refactoring
- **Summarize** for condensation and key points
- **Rewrite** for rephrasing while preserving meaning

Type a message and press **Enter** to send; **Shift+Enter** inserts a newline
instead of sending. The transcript — labelled **Conversation** — shows every
message with a role and a timestamp (`YOU · 31 Aug 2026 · 10:15`).

Every agent, Chat included, has an **Auto-route** button next to its run
controls: it asks the router for a recommended provider and model for the
current input and applies the choice directly. Any provider or model other
than Ollama is marked as a paid selection (an amber marker on the dropdown),
so a cloud route is visible before you run it, not only after the cost is
logged.

Saved chats can be searched and filtered by agent. The two side rails split by what they carry rather than by left/right habit: the right rail is the live request inspector — Current Route, Cost, Budget, System, in that order, so the cards read top-to-bottom in the order a request actually happens — while API Keys and Actions (Cost history, Run log, Settings) sit in the left rail with the agent list, since those are global setup rather than per-request state. Settings controls registered agents, tools, pricing, and provider permissions.

The in-app **Learning Centre** is available from **More (•••)**. It contains a
guided Quick Start, full workspace and Settings reference, courses for all
seven agents, privacy/cost guidance, troubleshooting, multi-agent workflows,
practice exercises, current-interface screenshots, and the v3 advanced-tools
roadmap. It also includes the complete testing roadmap for every agent, shared
control, and release mode. Training source files live in `docs/training/`; they
are separate from the developer reference in `docs/agents/`.

For a removable, self-contained macOS copy, see
[`docs/portable_mode.md`](docs/portable_mode.md). Portable mode keeps settings,
history, logs and API-key storage on the removable volume and never silently
mixes them with the Lab checkout or Application Support. Its portable-only
**Settings → General → Emergency Reset** can erase Sentinel-owned data and API
keys after two confirmations. It is a privacy reset, not a Tails-style amnesic
session or forensic wipe: macOS, network equipment and providers may retain
separate records, and files deliberately exported elsewhere are not removed.

Bloodhound's **File Discovery** searches only locations you deliberately enter.
It supports folders on this Mac and owned macOS/Linux machines reachable by
SSH. Remote searches use SFTP with the SSH agent, `~/.ssh/config`, and strict
`known_hosts` verification; Sentinel stores no password or private key. Search
filters include full or partial name, extensions, size, and modified date.
Results show name, path, type, size, and modified time. Searches read metadata
only, never send file information to an AI provider, do not follow directory
links, and stop at safety limits. They cannot change files. **Open SSH Terminal**
hands an explicitly entered host to the operating system's normal SSH client
for interactive administration outside Sentinel.

Tunnel's **Connection Check** is local and read-only by default. It reports
installed WireGuard/OpenVPN tools, detected tunnels, recent WireGuard handshake
and transfer totals when the `wg` status tool permits them, the current default
route, and configured DNS servers. A selected profile can
be compared with the snapshot to explain interface, endpoint, port, handshake,
and routing findings. Endpoint and port are checked for usable profile values,
but the live peer endpoint is deliberately not queried or verified.

Tunnel's **VPN Connection** brings a real tunnel up and down. Choosing a
WireGuard or OpenVPN profile and clicking **Connect** runs `wg-quick`/`openvpn`
through the macOS authorisation dialog after an explicit confirmation, and
**Disconnect** requests shutdown; both run off the interface thread. Command
success does not verify a handshake, routing, DNS, or traffic protection. OpenVPN
shutdown refuses if Sentinel cannot identify its tracked process; it never stops
all OpenVPN processes by name. **Import
config…** loads a `.conf`/`.ovpn`, reads its real server endpoint out of the
file, and stores it as a connectable profile. A few
country-labelled example profiles ship as explicit templates — they are marked
`(template)` and the connect path refuses them until you import a real config or
set a real endpoint, so nothing pretends to be a working server it is not. An
optional **Kill switch** (macOS pf) can be armed to block all traffic except the
selected tunnel's endpoint, so a dropped tunnel cannot leak; it refuses to arm
for a template or when the endpoint cannot be resolved, and reports its recovery
command on failure.
**Action Preview** still shows the equivalent commands without running them, and
**Connection Check** stays read-only. It never
requests private key material. Public-IP and latency
checks are optional, name the external destinations, and require a separate
confirmation; none of these paths uses an AI model or incurs model cost.
Normal app close and Portable Emergency Reset cancel and finish an active check
before the UI is torn down. Packaged builds include a non-secret starter profile
catalog so Tunnel does not depend on source-tree files.

**Inspect config…** reads one explicitly selected WireGuard file locally and
returns only its interface, routing, DNS, peer and endpoint summary. Private and
pre-shared key values are discarded during parsing; the source file is not sent
to a model, Saved Chats, or the run log. When a recent Connection Check exists,
Tunnel compares the file's intended full/split routing and DNS with that snapshot.

### Safety boundaries

Beacon, Bug Spray, and Tunnel are intended for systems, networks, and programs the operator owns or is explicitly authorised to assess. Trace and Bloodhound should be used lawfully and with respect for privacy. Bloodhound never scans a local or remote machine automatically: the operator must enter each host and folder and already possess valid SSH access. Generated commands and findings require human review before execution or submission.

Forge writes an agent scaffold and inactive registry entries after review. Sentinel does not dynamically load it or add it to the sidebar; inspect, test, and deliberately integrate generated code before enabling it, especially when it adds tools or external access.

## Architecture

The main runtime is organised around:

- `main.py` — application window, Chat workflow, navigation, shared request controls
- `agents/` — the Chat, Trace, Bloodhound, Beacon, and Forge package repos
  (`agents/chat_agent/`, `agents/osint_agent/`, `agents/osint_heavy_agent/`,
  `agents/wifi_agent/`, and `agents/manager_agent/`)
- `bug_spray/` — Bug Spray's standalone companion repo and the in-app
  `bug_bounty` message builder
- `agents/vpn_agent/` — Tunnel's VPN library, merged in-tree (formerly a
  standalone submodule): the `vpn` agent (`sentinel_chat_agent.py`), the
  `services/` stack (WireGuard/OpenVPN control, `privileged`, `killswitch`,
  `config_inspection`, DNS/latency/public-IP checks) and `server/` provisioning.
  The real connect path lives in `services/vpn_connection.py` and
  `services/openvpn_manager.py`
- `ui/panels/` — specialist panels for Trace, Bloodhound, Beacon, Bug Spray, Tunnel, and Forge
- `services/agent_catalog.py` — canonical built-in roster and metadata
- `VERSION` and `services/app_version.py` — canonical public version and the
  exact development-build description shown by the app
- `services/registry.py` and `services/validator.py` — permissions and tool/provider checks; `registry.py` also has a `projects` table with full CRUD (`docs/projects_roadmap.md`, Stage 2) that nothing in the UI reads or writes yet
- `services/database.py` — SQLite schema and built-in registration
- `services/*_client.py` — local and cloud model clients
- `services/usage_tracker.py` and `services/run_logger.py` — cost and request lifecycle records
- `config/tool_prompts.json` — Chat tool instructions
- `data/sentinel.db` — local application data
- `assets/` — `icon.icns` and its source PNG for the macOS app bundle; used by
  `scripts/install_app.sh`, `scripts/build_app.sh`, and `Sentinel.spec`
- `scripts/thin_launcher.c` — the native one-shot launcher compiled and
  installed by `scripts/install_app.sh`; execs the project's own `.venv`
  Python against `main.py` with no persistent launchd job
- `output/` — gitignored, generated-only. Currently holds leftover files from
  before this fork was narrowed to the security roster (`launch_assets/` has a
  KDP listing, an ARC outreach email and a BookTok pitch — publishing-agent
  output, not something this Sentinel builds). Safe to clear; nothing in this
  repo reads from it.

Built-in agents come from the canonical catalog. Forge-generated agents use the dynamic registry and remain separate from the built-in roster.

## Data and configuration

Development runs and the everyday thin launcher use the Lab project directory for writable data. Self-contained release builds use Sentinel's application-support directory. Runtime-path handling and initial seed copying live in `services/runtime_paths.py`.

### macOS launch modes

`./scripts/install_app.sh` installs the everyday thin launcher: a small compiled native shim (`scripts/thin_launcher.c`), not an AppleScript applet or a shell-script bundle. Launch Services starts the compiled executable; it forks a detached child that execs the project's own `.venv` Python against `main.py` while the parent returns immediately, so there is no persistent launchd job and no restart-on-exit policy — a quit or crash simply ends the process. It runs directly from this Lab checkout and uses this folder's `data/`, `config/`, and `.env`, exactly like `python main.py`.

`./scripts/build_app.sh` creates a self-contained release in `dist.noindex/` but does not install it. A self-contained build uses `~/Library/Application Support/Sentinel/` when launched. On first launch it renames existing `Sentinel Fork` application-support data in place; it never takes data from the archived `Sentinel AI` app. Installing with `./scripts/build_app.sh --install` explicitly replaces the thin launcher, so use that option only when you intend to switch modes. Source and frozen modes do not otherwise merge their data.

Both launch modes read the same canonical `VERSION`. The live launcher shows
the updated version on its next launch; packaged and portable copies keep the
version embedded at build time. Follow `docs/versioning.md` for every release
increment so the UI, bundle metadata and Lab monitor task remain aligned.

Important data includes saved chats, settings, usage, run history, and registry records. Do not replace or delete `data/sentinel.db` during an upgrade. Schema and roster changes should be applied through migrations that preserve user history.

Do not commit `.env`, credentials, generated reports containing sensitive information, or private investigation data.

## Testing

Run the automated suite from the activated environment:

```bash
pytest
```

The current manual acceptance checklist is in `tests/manual_test_cases.md`. It covers all seven built-in agents and verifies that Writing and Coding remain Chat tools rather than sidebar agents.
The [testing roadmap](docs/testing_roadmap.md) maps every shipped agent workflow
and shared control to automated, packaged-app, and owned-lab checks, with
priority and release gates. Sentinel's main test suite does not include the
separate Bug Spray companion-repository suite. (The VPN Agent code is now merged
in-tree; its connect/disconnect layer is covered by `tests/test_vpn_connection.py`.)
Tunnel's diagnostics and connection boundaries are covered by
`tests/test_vpn_diagnostics.py`, `tests/test_vpn_connection.py`, and the Tunnel
panel tests in `tests/test_ui_panels.py`.

## Further documentation

Agent-specific reference guides live in `docs/agents/`: `chat.md`, `osint.md`, `osint_heavy.md`, `wifi.md`, `bug_bounty.md`, `vpn.md`, and `manager.md`.
User training and the course roadmap live in [`docs/training/`](docs/training/).

Documents describing the workspace split or earlier architecture are historical records. They explain how features moved between projects; they do not define current Sentinel behaviour.
