## v2 — complete

V2 closed on 2026-09-12. The release checklist contains no deferred work; all
future and cross-project items are listed under V3 or in their owning project.

### Product and interface

- [x] Seven-agent Sentinel roster: Chat, Trace, Bloodhound, Beacon, Bug Spray, Tunnel and Forge; retired or moved agents no longer appear in the sidebar.
- [x] Shared panel architecture (`AgentHost` + `AgentPanel`) and specialist modules under `ui/panels/`.
- [x] Balanced sidebars, one-row run controls, compact History, three-level type/spacing scale, spend meters and paid-route highlighting.
- [x] Structured result cards for Trace, Bloodhound, Beacon, Bug Spray and Forge, with separate live-stream surfaces and collapsed raw output.
- [x] Chat sends with Enter, inserts a line with Shift+Enter, uses a larger composer, keeps the conversation scrollable and timestamps every message.
- [x] Chat Projects grouping: project picker, project/agent/text filters, project creation and assignment, restored project on open, and project attribution for chat and usage records.
- [x] Removed the obsolete READY pill and normalized specialist-panel margins to the 4/8/16/24 scale.
- [x] Offscreen renders of the nine Learning Centre screenshots were visually inspected at 1600×1000 after the final UI changes.

### Agents and local tools

- [x] Trace consent-gated Live Research for domains/IPs, usernames, email and companies, with partial results, cancellation and saved searches. Person/phone data-broker lookup remains deliberately excluded.
- [x] Bloodhound read-only local and authenticated SFTP file discovery with explicit roots, filters, safety limits, cancellation and no file-content handoff to AI.
- [x] Beacon read-only interface/adapter preflight and documented dual-interface workflow.
- [x] Tunnel phases 1–2: read-only connection diagnostics, selected-profile comparison and safe Connect/Disconnect/Restart previews with no execution path.
- [x] Tunnel phase 3a: local WireGuard configuration inspection that discards private and preshared keys at parse time and compares non-secret intent with the latest diagnostic snapshot.
- [x] Forge creates reviewable agent specifications before any scaffold is approved.
- [x] Bug Spray's canonical home is the nested companion used by Sentinel; no duplicate top-level implementation is maintained.

### Safety, cost and reliability

- [x] Every paid-provider request goes through authorization, budget, consent, usage and run logging, keyed by unique request id.
- [x] Exact `Decimal` budget boundaries, Kimi cached-input pricing, cloud timeouts and clear provider-permission errors.
- [x] `_note_failure` remains intentionally lightweight (stderr + tooltip); a queryable general `RunLogger.note` API is not required for V2.
- [x] Portable macOS mode keeps state on the selected drive, preserves data during upgrades, excludes source secrets, handles read-only/low-space media and offers a double-confirmed Sentinel-only Emergency Reset.
- [x] Product identity is Sentinel across source, bundle, runtime paths, single-instance key, documentation and Lab Hub. Legacy `Sentinel Fork` application-support data is migrated; archived `Sentinel AI` data is never touched.
- [x] Full release verification: 556 Sentinel tests, the complete nested VPN Agent suite and the complete Lab Hub suite pass.
- [x] Replaced the AppleScript/launchctl thin launcher with a compiled native one-shot shim (`scripts/thin_launcher.c`): Launch Services starts it, it execs the project's `.venv` Python against `main.py` in a detached child, and the parent returns at once — no persistent launchd job, no restart-on-exit policy.
- [x] Fixed the request inspector clipping its right edge in the narrowest sidebar width: `Meter`/`KeyValue` values and the cards container no longer impose a minimum width wider than the scroll viewport (`ui/widgets.py`, `main.py`).

## v3 — later

- [ ] `P0` `testing` `security` `@ai` **Testing roadmap — safety gate.** Isolate writable config as well as SQLite (the baseline suite changed `config/settings.json`), add a deny-by-default network/process harness, cover every agent's consent, scope, secret, budget, cancellation and write/delete boundary, plus installed-app Quit-stays-quit smoke. See `docs/testing_roadmap.md`.
- [ ] `P1` `testing` `@ai` **Testing roadmap — workflow matrix.** Complete success/error/cancel/persistence contracts for all seven agents, their distinct modes, all shared controls/providers/settings, and the separate companion-repo test runs. See `docs/testing_roadmap.md`.
- [ ] `P2` `testing` `docs` `@ai` **Testing roadmap — release acceptance.** Automate source/frozen/USB smoke where feasible, run owned-lab hardware/network cases and first-user Learning Centre review, and record unverified modes explicitly. See `docs/testing_roadmap.md`.
- [x] `P1` `feature` `docs` `@ai` **Learning Centre — complete curriculum.** Searchable Quick Start, workspace tour, controls and Settings, all seven agent courses, privacy/cost, troubleshooting, multi-agent workflows and advanced-tools guidance are shipped.
- [x] `P2` `docs` `design` `@ai` **Learning Centre — reproducible screenshots.** Nine current-interface images are generated from isolated fictional/empty state by `scripts/capture_training_screenshots.py`.
- [ ] `P2` `testing` `docs` `@ai` **Learning Centre exercises and first-user validation.** Add beginner, intermediate and independent exercises per agent, then test Quick Start with new users.
- [ ] `P1` `infra` `@ai` **Shared Lab platform package.** Extract provider clients, limits, usage, registry, database, runtime paths, request guard and common UI only when the other hubs are ready to consume one version.
- [ ] `P1` `infra` `security` `@ai` **External-tool adapter framework.** Dependency checks, structured output, previews, timeouts, cancellation, local audit records, privilege/scope gates and explicit cloud-handoff consent.
- [ ] `P1` `feature` `security` `@ai` **Tunnel phase 3b — gated WireGuard execution.** Separate target review, explicit confirmation, administrator authorization, local audit, rollback guidance and a fresh post-change check. OpenVPN execution remains blocked pending an equivalent adapter.
- [ ] `P2` `feature` `security` `@ai` **Tunnel phase 3c — key and recovery lifecycle.** Local key generation, protected backup/restore, integrity checking and recovery testing, with secret material excluded from chat and logs.
- [ ] `P2` `testing` `@ai` **Tunnel phase-three parity audit.** Verify source, frozen and USB-portable paths plus close/reset behavior after the execution and recovery work exists.
- [ ] `P2` `feature` `@ai` **Chat Projects stages 2.3–2.6.** Project instructions, defaults, budget and management UI; grouping remains useful and safe without these behavior-changing additions.
- [ ] `P2` `feature` `security` `@ai` **Staged specialist integrations.** Bloodhound metadata/rule matching, Trace public-source adapters, authorised Bug Spray assessment and passive Beacon analysis. Exclude denial of service, credential theft, stealth/persistence and uncontrolled exploitation.
- [ ] `P2` `feature` `@ai` Streaming responses in Chat.
- [ ] `P2` `feature` `@ai` Automatic Ollama fallback when a cloud budget cap is reached.
- [ ] `P3` `infra` `@ai` One retry-with-backoff wrapper shared across providers.
- [ ] `P3` `feature` `@ai` Export a run—prompt, response, usage and cost—as one Markdown file.

# Detail

---

## 1. Paid API calls bypass every guardrail outside the chat panel  ⚠️

**22 sites construct a `ChatWorker` directly; there is 1 `validator.validate`
call and 0 usage-tracking calls in the whole app.**

Only `send_prompt()` (the chat panel's Send button) runs the guarded sequence:

    estimate cost → validator.validate (budget) → confirm_external_api_request
    → run_logger.start → ChatWorker → log_request + save_chat + run_logger.finish

Every other runner (`osint_analyse`, `roi_analyse`, `health_analyse`,
`inv_analyse`, `nfl_bet_analyse`, `music_analyse`, `webdesign_generate`,
`wifi_run`, the author/manuscript generators, …) picks a provider that may be a
paid one and calls `ChatWorker` directly. Consequences:

- the €1 session / €5 daily caps do not apply to most of the app;
- "Cost Today" and "Requests Today" stay at 0 no matter what those agents spend;
- no confirmation prompt before spending money;
- nothing is written to Saved Chats (which is why every saved chat is `chat:`).

**Fix:** two helpers on `GodAI`, and every runner calls them —

- `authorize_request(agent, tool, provider, model, prompt) -> bool`
  (estimate → validate → confirm → `run_logger.start`; `False` means blocked)
- `record_request(agent, tool, provider, model, prompt, messages, response, usage)`
  (`log_request` → session totals → `save_chat` → `run_logger.finish`)

This closes four separate defects with one change.

**Status: DONE (2026-08-12).** `authorize_request` / `record_request` /
`abandon_request` / `note_request_usage` live on `GodAI`, and all 19 previously
unguarded `ChatWorker` sites call them — 20 `authorize_request`, 19
`record_request`, 17 `abandon_request`. Verified: all 12 agent panels are
refused when the provider checkbox is off, and a completed run now bills the
session and writes a Saved Chat under its own agent name.

Two things surfaced while wiring it:

- `Registry` reads the **SQLite DB**, not `config/registry.json` (the JSON is
  only a seed via `_migrate_registry`). Both were updated.
- `chat`, `osint` and `manuscript` did not list `anthropic` or `kimi` in
  `allowed_providers`, and no tool listed them either — so picking Anthropic or
  Kimi anywhere was already being rejected as "does not permit provider" before
  any of this. Fixed in the DB and the seed.

Not wired, deliberately: `roi`, `investment` (moved to the SONAR app — see the
comment in `_seed_default_agents`) and `ops_identity`, none of which have an
agent module or panel here. **`ops_identity` is still listed in the sidebar and
`agent_titles` despite having no implementation — a dead menu entry worth
removing.**

Concurrency caveat: **resolved.** `_pending_requests` moved from being keyed
by agent name to a `request_id` (`uuid4().hex`, generated in
`authorize_request`), with a backward-compatible fallback to the agent name
when no id is passed. Two simultaneous runs of the same agent now resolve
against their own context instead of clobbering each other's. See the v2
checklist above and `tests/test_request_guard.py`.

## 2. `main.py` is too big — IN PROGRESS (phases 1–3 of 5 done)

One file holds 17 agent UIs, routing, cost logic, history and styling. The cost
is concrete: a checkbox-spacing fix had to go in the global stylesheet because
the pattern repeats everywhere, and a card-padding fix touched 6 identical
`setContentsMargins` calls. (`list_models()` ×64, `QGroupBox(` ×57,
`setContentsMargins` ×75, `provider_box.addItems` ×13.)

**Fix:** one module per agent panel (`ui/panels/osint.py`, …) plus a shared
`AgentPanel` base for the provider/model/actions row all 17 rebuild by hand.
Do this *after* #1 — the shared helper makes the seam obvious.

**Plan written: `docs/refactor_plan.md`** (2026-08-12). Measured layout, a
five-phase order that ends green at every step, and the finding that makes it
tractable: each agent vertical is ~75% self-contained and the code it reaches
outside itself is the same ~15-member interface every time (provider clients,
the request guard from #1, `run_backend`, `agent_instances`, `_note_failure`).
**Phase 1 is DONE (2026-08-12):** `ui/workers.py` (212), `ui/widgets.py` (161),
`ui/style.py` (315) and `ui/tooltips.py` (252) extracted verbatim; `main.py`
11,902 → 11,007. Verified at runtime, not just by import — the stylesheet is
applied and tooltips are live.

**Phase 2 is DONE (2026-08-12):** the four `show_*` dialogs moved to
`ui/dialogs.py` (735 lines), a net −696 in `main.py`. `GodAI` keeps four
three-line wrappers, so no call site changed. Each body is byte-identical to the
original after `self`→`app` and one dedent — diff-verified rather than eyeballed.

The trap worth carrying into Phase 3: **a missing import does not fail at import
time.** The moved bodies referenced five provider wrappers plus `Registry` and
`Validator`; `ui/dialogs.py` compiled and imported fine, and only
`show_model_guide` raised `NameError` when actually opened. Guessing the import
list from a regex missed all seven; walking the AST for `Load`ed names not bound
in the module found them at once. The check that caught it was stubbing
`QDialog.exec` and opening all four dialogs, asserting on their contents.

**Phase 3 is DONE (2026-08-20):** `ui/host.py` (90) holds the `AgentHost`
protocol and `ui/panels/base.py` (215) the `AgentPanel` base; `tests/test_ui_panels.py`
(77 tests) covers both. The design decision is settled — **composition**, so a
panel holds a host rather than sharing a namespace with it, and 20 of those tests
build a panel against a 42-line fake host with no `GodAI` and no window.

No vertical moved, which is why `main.py` only went 5,520 → 5,378. What went was
the duplication the verticals would otherwise have carried with them: seven copies
of the provider list, six hand-built provider/model rows, six `*_load_models`
methods (which had already drifted — three reported a load failure, three
swallowed it), and `AGENT_MODEL_LOADERS`, a map of method *names* resolved by
`getattr`, now a registry each panel fills in as it builds.

The trap this time, again runtime-only: **an unparented row container takes its
widgets with it.** The combos belong to the container of the layout they are added
to, so a container that falls out of scope leaves every combo raising
`RuntimeError: Internal C++ object already deleted` from lines that have nothing
to do with ownership. `flow_row(parent)` takes a parent now.

**Phase 4 is DONE.** Bundled into the `chore: initialize Sentinel AI fork`
commit (2026-08-22) that split this project out of Sentinel AI's history: all
six verticals — osint, osint_heavy, wifi, bug_bounty, vpn, manager — landed in
`ui/panels/`. `main.py` 5,378 → 3,567 in that commit (it also carried other
fork-specific reshaping — `services/registry.py`, `services/pricing.py`,
`services/model_router.py` — so the drop isn't a pure panel-move number the way
Phases 1–3 were). `main.py` has since grown to 4,082 lines on new feature work
(the Trace Live Research slices below), which is expected — the phase measured
a one-time structural move, not a ceiling.

Not part of this phase: `_pending_requests` stayed keyed by agent name at the
time of this move. It has since been fixed (see the bug item above and
`docs/refactor_plan.md`).

## 3. Other agent panels still crush when the window is narrow

`FlowLayout` (main.py) fixed the chat panel: a `QHBoxLayout` reports the sum of
its children as its minimum width, so a long control row pins an impossible
minimum on the pane and Qt compresses buttons past their own minimums —
labels get chopped to "uto Rout", "ecomme".

**Status: DONE (2026-08-12).** 13 control rows converted to `FlowLayout`:

| panel           | min width before | after |
|-----------------|-----------------:|------:|
| AuthorPanel     | 1091 | 403 |
| WiFiPanel       |  803 | 462 |
| NFLBetPanel     |  728 | 473 |
| OSINTPanel      |  728 | 257 |
| OSINTHeavyPanel |  728 | 503 |
| WebdesignPanel  |  728 | 507 |
| ManuscriptPanel |  711 | 670 |
| BugBountyPanel  |  704 | 573 |

The result that matters: the splitter's minimum width is now **985px, under the
window's own 1000px minimum**, so the three panes fit at the narrowest allowed
window and nothing can be crushed. It was 1460px when this started.

Notes for future conversions:

- Rows come in three shapes and all three needed handling: `addLayout(row)`,
  `addLayout(row, r, c, rs, cs)` into a `QGridLayout`, and `QHBoxLayout(widget)`
  built straight onto a container.
- `FlowLayout.addWidget` now accepts (and ignores) `QBoxLayout`'s stretch and
  alignment arguments, so a `QHBoxLayout` can be swapped in without touching
  call sites — the fiverr panel passes a stretch factor.
- `addStretch()` calls were dropped: a stretch has no meaning once items wrap.

Not converted: the API-key rows (771px). They live inside a scroll area, so
their width no longer drives any pane minimum.

## 4. No timeouts on any cloud client

`ollama_client` sets 10s/300s. All five paid clients — `openai_client`,
`deepseek_client`, `kimi_client`, `gemini_client`, `anthropic_client` — passed
no timeout at all, so a hung connection froze that agent with no recovery.

**Status: DONE (2026-08-12).** `services/api_limits.py` holds the shared values
(120s, 1 retry) and all five clients use them. Verified on the constructed SDK
objects, not just in source; a request to a black-hole address now raises
`APITimeoutError` instead of hanging.

Two notes for whoever tunes this: google-genai's `HttpOptions` takes
**milliseconds** while the other four SDKs take seconds, and the timeout applies
*between streamed chunks* rather than to the whole generation — so 120s does not
cap a slow model.

## 5. Silent `except: pass` blocks

Failures vanished, including around history loading and model listing — if
`load_history_list` threw, the list was silently empty and looked identical to
"you have no saved chats".

**Status: DONE (2026-08-12).** All 12 were replaced with
`except Exception as exc: self._note_failure(...)`. The helper writes
`[warn] <context>: <type>: <message>` to stderr — which the app launcher already
captures in `/tmp/sentinelai_launch.log` — and, where a widget is passed,
attaches the reason to it as a tooltip so an empty model dropdown explains
itself without reading a log.

Covered: the eight `*_load_models` methods, `apply_agent_recommendation`,
`_ops_write_env_key`, `load_history_list` and `closeEvent`. The last two are
still non-fatal on purpose (shutdown, and a key that is already saved in the
database) — they just say so now instead of disappearing.

Verified by injecting a `ConnectionError` into a provider: the failure reaches
stderr and the tooltip, the call does not raise, and the UI survives.

One `except Exception: pass` remains on purpose, inside `_note_failure` itself:
the error reporter must never raise.

`RunLogger` was not used for this — its API is run-scoped (`start`/`finish`/
`cancel`) with no general note method. Adding one would be the tidier home for
these if they ever need to be queryable.

## 6. Test coverage is inverted

The scenario tests cover agent prompt construction, but nothing covered
routing, cost estimation, validation or history — the money logic was the
untested part.

**Status: DONE (2026-08-12).** `tests/test_cost_and_limits.py` adds 31 tests
over the two things that decide whether money is spent and how much:
`Validator` (all ten rules, incl. per-agent/session/daily caps, the paid-provider
checkboxes, and ollama's exemption) and `UsageTracker` token/cost accounting
(each SDK's token naming, exact/estimated/mixed, cost invariants).

They are real tests, not decoration — verified by mutation: deleting the
session-budget check fails `test_request_over_session_budget_is_refused`, and
making the token estimate return zero fails three tests. Both mutations were
reverted and the sources confirmed byte-identical.

Design notes: `Validator` takes its registry by injection, so the gate tests use
a stub and never touch the database. `calculate_cost_eur` does read the pricing
table, so it is asserted on invariants (local is free, unknown backend is free,
cost rises with tokens, never negative) rather than hardcoded prices, which
would break whenever pricing is edited.

`authorize_request` / `record_request` / `abandon_request` are now covered too
— `tests/test_request_guard.py`, 30 tests. It builds `GodAI` once per module
(constructing it costs ~10s, so per-test was 118s and unusable) and swaps the
usage tracker, chat history and run logger for fakes, so no test bills a request
or writes into `data/chats/` — verified by comparing row and file counts either
side of a run.

What it pins is the behaviour where a bug costs money: a blocked or declined
request opens no run, recording without authorising bills nothing, double-record
bills once, and an abandoned request stays unbilled even if a late response
arrives. Mutation-verified — making `record_request` or `abandon_request` leak
their pending context fails the double-billing tests.

Deliberately not duplicated: the ten `Validator` gates and the token/cost maths
stay owned by `test_cost_and_limits.py`. `test_request_guard.py` keeps only three
edge cases that file does not reach, one of which pins a float-precision quirk —
`1.00 - 0.90 == 0.09999999999999998`, so a request estimated at exactly the
remaining budget is refused. It fails safe, and a switch to `Decimal` should
flip it.

## 7. Full GUI overhaul

The colours are right; hierarchy, density and information design are not. Three
measurements rather than opinions: the type scale was five sizes of which four
read as one; **12 `_parse_*_sections` methods** structure every agent's answer
and **70 text panes** then render it flat; and three control rows sit between
you and the input box.

Direction and mock screens: **`docs/gui_redesign.md`** plus the published
mockup (run bar, section-rendered Trace output, narrow-window reflow).

- [x] **Type and spacing scale** — three sizes, two weights, documented in
      `ui/style.py` with the 15px section-title role reserved.
- [x] **Status rail figures** — `Meter`/`Bar` in `ui/widgets.py` driving system
      and budget; exact numbers moved to tooltips.
- [x] **Flat agent list.** `CollapsibleSection` is gone from the sidebar —
      confirmed no references remain in `main.py` or `ui/panels/`.
- [x] **Run bar.** `execution_mode_box` and the provider/model tools now sit in
      a hidden combo driven from a submenu (`add_combo_submenu`) rather than a
      permanent control row.
- [x] **Section renderer, Trace.** `ui/panels/osint.py` builds a `SectionView`
      for its output. The remaining five agents are tracked separately above
      (item 2 in the v2 checklist).

Deliberately not proposed: a new palette (the one part that is not broken), and
a command palette (the sidebar was never the bottleneck — the control rows
were; revisit once the run bar exists).

---

## Smaller items

- Saved Chats: **DONE (2026-08-12)** — agent filter above the search box, and
  double-click to rename. The filter is built from the chats that exist, so it
  only offers agents actually used, and it intersects with the search box rather
  than overriding it. Rename writes the `title` field that
  `chat_title_from_data` already preferred but nothing ever wrote. One pass over
  the files serves both the filter options and the rows, so no extra disk reads.

  Next step is **Chat Projects Stage 2** — see `docs/projects_roadmap.md`. Stage
  1 (this) made the list tidier; Stage 2 turns a group of chats into a context
  bundle (instructions, defaults, optional budget), which is the part that
  earns its keep. The backend side is now in place (`projects` table, registry
  CRUD, `save_chat(project=...)`, and placeholder state in `main.py`) — what's
  left is entirely UI: a picker, a filter, and a way to create/assign a
  project. See the checklist item above.
- `BUDGET` card: `Session €` / `Daily €` could share one row (~34px saved), but
  the two label+field pairs do not fit the sidebar's ~250px inner width without
  shortening the labels.
